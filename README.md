# Bookmarks

Bookmarks is a project that, as the name suggests, is for bookmarks, or more precisely, for storing them.  
The application has a function for adding new bookmarks as well as removing specific ones.  
Thanks to local storage, the bookmarks will remain even when the application is closed.  
It is an interesting alternative to the standard browser bar.
